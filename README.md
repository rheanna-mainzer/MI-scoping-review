Data and code for our scoping review of causal effect estimation with multiple imputation in observational studies.

MASTER.R will run the following in order:
  * clean_dat.R - prepare data for analysis
  * tables_for_paper.R - produce tables of results
  * figures_for_paper.R - produce Figure 2

Output:
 * Tables will be stored in a /tables directory.
 * Figures will be stored in a /figures directory.
