The cohorts included ~32000 mother-child pairs with harmonized information on the urban exposome. 1301 pairs were characterized for their internal exposome.
 -Birth weight (outcome) and gestational duration data obtained for 1287 mother-child pairs.
- Lead discussed as a concerning exposure, therefore treated as the primary exposure
- 41% missing covariate
- Supplementary Material S3 provides detail on imputation procedure
- Authors used health variables as predictors as they expected them to be associated with the probability of having a missing value (Not MCAR implict in modelling strategy)
- MI used to impute missing exposure and covariate data
- Sensitivity analysis restricted to non-imputed exposure values (assume that covariates were still imputed). ""Yet, for the exposures most strongly associated with fetal growth in ExWAS, associations were stronger after restriction to the population with non-imputed exposure values which is in favour of our missing data imputation procedure not biasing estimates away from the null.""
- Variable selection procedure for imputation model likely led to omission of covariates in main analysis from imputation procedure (described in Supplementary Material S3)"
